Aggriget method

1. Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12] 
   Output: [1,3,12,0,0]   
2. Find the second largest value in an array using stream API.
3. Sql Query to find the all Employee details who has max sallary in each department.
 Left join Vs Right join
4. Post Request Vs Put Request
   @SpringBootApplication -> Break Down
   @Id 
   @GenerationValue
5. Embaded Server Tomcat in Spring Boot, if possible then configuration to change this server with other.
6. Find the second max sallary of an employee

1. find the minimum step to find the destination on a line starting from point 0.
Ex. a) d=0 -> 0 -> 0(ans)
    b) d=1 -> 0,+1 -> 1
	c) d=2 -> 0,+1,-2,+3 -> 3
	d) d=3 -> 0,+1,+2 -> 2
	e) d=4 -> 0,+1,-2,+3,+2 -> 4
	f) d=10 -> 0,+1,+2,+3,+4 -> 4
	
2. find the maximum length of Arithmatic Expression(AP) from the given sorted set.
Ex. a) {1,7,10,13,14,19} -> {1,7,13,19} -> 4(ans)
    b) {1,7,10,13,14} -> {1,7,13} / {7,10,13} -> 3(ans)
	
3. find the minimum cost to reach the bottom-right cell of matrix from left-top cell.
   if cost -1 cant move downward, if cost -2 cant move forward, if cost -3 cant move.
   where cost is in negative then no cost.
   if not possible print "No path".
Ex.  3 3
     1 3 -2
     2 -3 5
     3 4 2
  (1+3+0+5+2 ->11)/ (1+2+3+4+2 ->12) -> 11(ans)	 
   
123 456 -> 123 654 -> 321654 -> 456123
